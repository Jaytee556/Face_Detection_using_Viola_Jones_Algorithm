# Face_Detection_using_Viola_Jones_Algorithm
This project aims to detect faces, eyes and smiles using the Viola-Jones Algorithm. 

### Important libraries to use: 
- cv2: cv2 is the OpenCV library, which is used for image and video processing
- Streamlit: streamlit is a library for building interactive web applications with Python.

***Load the face cascade classifier***
- `Face cascade classifier` is a machine learning algorithm used for object detection, particularly for detecting human faces in images or videos. It uses a trained model based on the Haar-like features to identify regions in an image that likely contain a face.

***The Viola-Jones algorithm***: 
- It is a popular object detection framework used for real-time face detection. 
- It is based on machine learning techniques and uses Haar-like features to identify objects within images or videos efficiently.
- It is popular because of its accuracy and speed.
